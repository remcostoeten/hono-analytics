description: No code comments
Code must be self-explanatory and readable without comments.
 
🚫 Not Allowed
- ❌ No inline comments (e.g., `// filter out inactive users`)
- ❌ No block comments (e.g., `/* function to get emails */`)
- ❌ No explanatory comments above functions or variables
 
✅ Allowed
- ✅ Only comment if absolutely necessary to clarify non-standard or obscure syntax (e.g., bitwise hacks, regex edge cases)
- ✅ Use clear, descriptive function and variable names instead of comments

We do write JSdoc/docstring for utiliteis,helpers,core,businesslogic,api,database stuff. But only in this format: @name followed by @description of 2 or 3 sentences. If we need a @example block we add it BELOW all code.
