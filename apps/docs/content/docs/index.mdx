## Install

```bash
bun add honolytics // or pnpm
```
<small>or if you're a maniac npm/yarn</small>
## Setup
You'll need a api key for your own authentication. This can be anything but we recommend creating a minimal 32 long secret. U can generate one here. In the future when we'll offer a hosted solution with your own dashboard than you'll need a specific api key generated by us.
<CreateApiKey />

```tsx
import { HonolyticsProvider } from 'honolytics'

export default function App() {
  return (
    <HonolyticsProvider
      apiKey={process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_ANALYTICS_KEY!}
      endpoint={process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_ANALYTICS_URL!}
    >
      <YourApp/> || {children}
    </HonolyticsProvider>
  )
}
```
