# GET /health

Simple health check endpoint to verify the API server is running and responsive.

## Request

```
GET /health
```

### Headers

No special headers required. Authentication is not needed for this endpoint.

## Response

### Success (200 OK)

```json
{
  "status": "ok",
  "timestamp": "2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z"
}
```

### Response Schema

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `status` | string | Always `"ok"` when server is healthy |
| `timestamp` | string | ISO timestamp of the response |

## Example

```bash
curl "http://localhost:8000/health"
```

Response:
```json
{
  "status": "ok", 
  "timestamp": "2024-08-23T12:34:56.789Z"
}
```

## Use Cases

### Development Verification

Check if the backend server is running during development:

```bash
# Quick health check
curl -f "http://localhost:8000/health" && echo "✅ Backend is running"
```

### Production Monitoring

Use in monitoring and health check services:

```javascript path=null start=null
async function checkApiHealth() {
  try {
    const response = await fetch('https://your-api.com/health')
    const data = await response.json()
    
    if (data.status === 'ok') {
      console.log('✅ API is healthy')
      return true
    } else {
      console.error('❌ API health check failed:', data)
      return false
    }
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('❌ API is unreachable:', error)
    return false
  }
}
```

### Docker Health Checks

Include in Docker health checks:

```dockerfile
HEALTHCHECK --interval=30s --timeout=3s --retries=3 \
  CMD curl -f http://localhost:8000/health || exit 1
```

### Load Balancer Health Checks

Configure load balancers to use this endpoint for backend health verification.

## Notes

- This endpoint does not require authentication
- Does not perform deep database connectivity checks
- Primarily verifies the HTTP server is responsive
- Response time should be very fast (< 100ms typically)

For more comprehensive monitoring, consider implementing custom health checks that verify database connectivity and other critical dependencies.
